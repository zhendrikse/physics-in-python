This repository contains physics demos, mainly using [VPython](https://vpython.org/).

- **`src`** &rarr; contains the sources
  - `demos` &rarr; demos using the generic toolbox.
  - **`toolbox`** &rarr; tools such as springs, bolls, and chargers, with which demos can readily be created.
  - **`trinket`** &rarr; the original GlowScript code snippets that can be found on [Trinket](https://trinket.io/).
    However, these snippets can also be executed stand-alone, i.e. independently of the Trinket environment.
- **`test`** &rarr; the tests of the components in the generic toolbox

# Python physics demos from [Dot Physics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVxIDFY01y4n_c2lK1TB-KA)

These demos are _refactored versions_ of the originals, found 
by the followling hyperlinks below. I have tried to make the
original code more object-oriented and make it [reval its intent](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html).

## Water Sprinkler

- See [my code in action](https://trinket.io/glowscript/3ec01917098d) on [https://trinket.io](trinket)
- Based on the original [water sprinkler](https://rhettallain.com/2019/11/12/modeling-a-spinning-sprinkler/) blog post and the code presented therein

## Elastic collision

- See [my code in action](https://trinket.io/glowscript/d7600bd4705a) on [https://trinket.io](trinket)
- Based on the original [elastic collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_p-5YfUSnw&t=11s) video and the code presented therein

## Chain falling from table

- See [my code in action](https://trinket.io/glowscript/c3e556761469) on [https://trinket.io](trinket)
- Based on the original [chain falling from table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXp1hW_t-bo) video and the code presented therein

## Ball falling on spring

- See [my code in action](https://trinket.io/glowscript/92ffad53ab4d) on [https://trinket.io](trinket)
- Based on the original [ball falling on spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExxDuRTIe0E) video and the code presented therein

## Three-body problem
