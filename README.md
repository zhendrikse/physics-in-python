This repository contains physics demos, mainly using VPython.

- `src` directory contains the sources
  - `demos` contains demos using the generic toolbox.
  - `toolbox` contains tools such as springs, bolls, and chargers, with which demos can readily be created.
  - `trinket` contains the original GlowScript code snippets that can be found on [Trinket](https://trinket.io/).
    However, these snippets can also be executed stand-alone, i.e. independently of the Trinket environment.
- `test` directory contains the tests of the components in the generic toolbox

# Python physics demos from [Dot Physics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVxIDFY01y4n_c2lK1TB-KA)

These demos are _refactored versions_ of the originals, found 
by the followling hyperlinks below. I have tried to make the
original code more object-oriented and make it [reval its intent](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html).
